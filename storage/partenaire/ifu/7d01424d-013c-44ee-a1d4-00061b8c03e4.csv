TCP sessions are established by a three-way handshake and use random 32-bit sequence and acknowledgement numbers to ensure the validity of traffic. A vulnerability was reported that may permit TCP sequence numbers to be more easily approximated by remote attackers. This issue affects products released by multiple vendors.   <P> The cause of the vulnerability is that affected implementations will accept TCP sequence numbers within a certain range  known as the acknowledgement range  of the expected sequence number for a packet in the session. This is determined by the TCP window size  which is negotiated during the three-way handshake for the session. Larger TCP window sizes may be set to allow for more throughput  but the larger the TCP window size  the more probable it is to guess a TCP sequence number that falls within an acceptable range. It was initially thought that guessing an acceptable sequence number was relatively difficult for most implementations given random distribution  making this type of attack impractical. However  some implementations may make it easier to successfully approximate an acceptable TCP sequence number  making these attacks possible with a number of protocols and implementations. <P> This is further compounded by the fact that some implementations may support the use of the TCP Window Scale Option  as described in RFC 1323  to extend the TCP window size to a maximum value of 1 billion. <P> This vulnerability will permit a remote attacker to inject a SYN or RST packet into the session  causing it to be reset and effectively allowing for denial of service attacks. An attacker would exploit this issue by sending a packet to a receiving implementation with an approximated sequence number and a forged source IP address and TCP port. <P> There are a few factors that may present viable target implementations  such as those which depend on long-lived TCP connections  those that have known or easily guessed IP address endpoints and those implementations with easily guessed TCP source ports. It has been noted that Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is reported to be particularly vulnerable to this type of attack  due to the use of long-lived TCP sessions and the possibility that some implementations may use the TCP Window Scale Option. As a result  this issue is likely to affect a number of routing platforms. <P> Another factor to consider is the relative difficulty of injecting packets into TCP sessions  as a number of receiving implementations will reassemble packets in order  dropping any duplicates. This may make some implementations more resistant to attacks than others. <P> It should be noted that while a number of vendors have confirmed this issue in various products  investigations are ongoing and it is likely that many other vendors and products will turn out to be vulnerable as the issue is investigated further."",""Successful exploitation of this issue could lead to denial of service attacks on the TCP based services of target hosts.
